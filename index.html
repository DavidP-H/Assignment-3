    <p class="text">What are the future possibilities?<br><br>Future possibilities in this career are very good. As society moves more towards a more online presence, with more and more people owning internet-connected devices, the need for network engineers will be in high demand to build new networks as well as expand, maintain, and upgrade existing ones.</p>
    <p class="text">What is the salary range?<br><br>The salary range for a network engineer in Ontario is between $51,000 and $128,000 per year, with an average network engineer in Ontario making $90,000 per year.</p>
    <p class="text">Why are you interested in this career?<br><br>I am interested in this career because I spend most of my time on the internet and loved the experience of learning about how my computer works and would really like to have a better understanding of how the networks that power our societies work. I am taking part in an Introduction to Networking course at Carleton University this June and am excited to find out whether this is really the career for me with some more insight into what a Network engineer might do on a day-to-day basis.</p>

      <li>I must also minor from another Faculty and obtain 30 credits from electives.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Vocation</h3>
    <p class="text">My vocation will help the common good because as the world progresses towards a more internet-connected society, there will be an elevated need for new networks to be made, as well as build on, upgrade, and maintain the current networks in place. This will help people around the world to communicate and share information more effectively, making improving society a little bit easier. My vocation will enable me to set appropriate goals and priorities because in order to become a network engineer one must be very organized, this organization will carry over into my school, work, and personal life.</p>
